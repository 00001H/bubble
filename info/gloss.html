The term "suboptimal practice" refers to the status quo, how things are implemented in reality outside of the Bubble. "Suboptimal" refers to the fact that these practices are often inefficient. Note that this is a purely <em>subjective</em> (and maybe a bit exaggerated) judgement based on the Core Principle of Efficiency.

Efficiency can be defined as <dfn>the extent of which resouce usage is minimized in achieving a goal</dfn>, and is the guiding principle of the Bubble.
