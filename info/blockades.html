        <h1>Blockades to efficiency</h1>
        <p>
Most people are not trying to intentionally hinder efficiency, and <a href="../_notwritten.html">suboptimal practice</a> is not suboptimal without reason. Here are some of the reasons why efficiency is not achieved in suboptimal practice:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Historical decisions</h2>
                <p>
"Historical reasons" or "backwards compatibility" are common causes of inefficiency, for example: Microsoft Windows aims to remain compatible with DOS programs, so it forbids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS#Reserved_device_names">various file and folder names</a> in all locations. Often, they are unjustified, and are in fact short-termism where long-term costs caused by inefficiencies are ignored in favor of the immediate short-term benefit of reduced upgrade costs.

                <h2>The human nature</h2>
                <p>
Humans are lazy: we try to do the least work possible to achieve a certain goal. At first glance, this seems to align with our <a href="../concepts/efficiency.html">definition of efficiency</a>, but the main problem is that this only concerns the work done by us: We are very happy to defer work to other people or tools even when they would have use many times more resoureces than if we did it ourselves. One example is learning how to use new tools: Many people don't take the time to read the manuals that comes with them and use the tools wrongly, then proceed to blame the designer for allowing the tool to be used this way at all. The purpose of tools is to enable us to do things that we couldn't do and save resources on those that we can do, not to forbid us from abusing them to create problems and inefficiencies.
