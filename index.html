            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
The Bubble is a project that attempts to maximize efficiency in different tasks at all costs and procedures, with a slight focus on computer software design (both in software architecture and UI design). The project focuses on the theoretical best, and is intentionally unhindered by (in other words, oblivious of) practical concerns like appealing to users. However, it is not meant to be completely un-implementable; it is merely likely to be unsuccessful if attempted under real-world conditions.

This website contains some info pages, but is mainly a blog where I talk about various instances of inefficiency found in real life (and how they could be fixed) as well as applying the principle of efficiency in practice. Currently there isn't much written on the website yet; however, you can take a look at the article about <a href="concepts/efficiency.html">the Core Principle of Efficiency</a>, which explains the concept of efficiency in detail, and <a href="info/blockades.html">Blockades to efficiency</a>, which describes some problems preventing efficency from being implemented in practice. The <a href="info/gloss.html">Glossary</a> is a collection of terms used in the Bubble articles.<br><br>
Important: these articles are incomplete and will be expanded in the future.

            <h2>Naming</h2>
            <p>
A bubble is a sealed container, meaning it completely separates the inside from the outside. I think this is appropriate because that's what the Bubble is: a separation of theoretically maximized efficiency from real-word practicality issues.
