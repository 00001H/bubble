        <h1>The Core Principle of Efficiency</h1>
        <p>
It is absolutely critical that everything is <em>efficient</em> (i.e. achieving a goal while consuming the least resources). This is the guiding principle for the Bubble. However, in <a href="../info/gloss.html#suboptimal-practice" class="concept">suboptimal practice</a>, people often waste resources on unnecessary things in (usually false) belief that it will improve intuitiveness or ease of learning enough to offset the cost.
        </p>
        <h2>Types of inefficiency in suboptimal practice</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Unnecessary noise</h3>
                <p>
Unnecessary noise (audio or otherwise) hinders efficiency, because it wastes your <a href="../_notwritten.html" class="concept">attention</a>. For example, it is obviously very absurd to have a sign in front of every existing piece of private property each with the full text of all laws related to trespassing on it, but some people may not realize this is the same type of inefficiency as having <span class="mono">COPY</span> in the context (right click) menu of text editors. (nobody will use them over <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>, so the entry just serves as a distraction every time you open up the menu.)
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Most efficient things are:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Simple:</h3>
                <p>
The simplest way of doing something is often the best way of doing it. Practice minimalism and avoid adding complexity where unnecessary. In fact, complexity often makes something harder to understand and harder to change, therefore making it inefficient because extra time and attention is wasted.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Modular:</h3>
                <p>
Being modular means that smaller components are clearly seperated and can often be removed or changed individually with little to no impact on other components. This is important for two reasons:
<ol>
    <li>
The components are easier to update when requirements change or defects are discovered, because affected components can often be directly changed without changing other components, reducing the amount of work that needs to be done.
    </li>
    <li>
If one or more components are deemed unnecessary for a particular use case, they can be easily removed, and will not waste resources.
    </li>
</ol>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
