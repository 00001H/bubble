        <h1>Intuition, abstraction, and modular vocabularies: toki pona and efficient minimalism - The Bubble</h1>
        <p>
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Tokiponists will note that many (often inexperienced) people are hasty to criticize toki pona for its apparent flaws while not recognizing that many problems arising from their purely theoretical analysis (of which this article is apparently one) rarely occur in practice. This article is not that: I'm not saying that toki pona has a problem (One year of personal experience shows that toki pona is not flawed, at least in <a href="../_notwritten.html" class="concept">suboptimal practice</a>). Rather, this article explores a generic optimization to language (as guided by the <a href="../concepts/efficiency.html">Core Principle of Efficiency</a>). toki pona was just chosen because its simple vocabulary is relatively easy to analyze.
